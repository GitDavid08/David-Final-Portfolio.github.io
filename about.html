              <p class="text-ready">I grew up in Commerce City, Colorado from two mexican parents. I watched a lot of cartoons, movies and played video--games,That is some of the reason that I wanted to be a Artist.
                The other main reason what I am today is because of my mother; She helped me go into another world, she set an example up for me and it got me to where I am today. I draw because I wanted to copy my mother and show her that I could do the same as her.
                That is why I want to have a certificate in graphic design so I could get exposure and show people. Art is something that helps people and I want to get involved. Although I am not a expert yet in Art, I want to learn and achieve it.
                I want to show people the real me, through my eyes. Thank you to all my family and friends; I hope I can work with differrent people and achieve Knowledge together.
